	<title>OGC KML 2.x Conformance Test Suite</title>
	<description>
	    This test suite verifies that a KML 2.x resource conforms to the following OGC specifications: 
	    1. OGC KML, Version 2.3 (OGC 12-007r2) 2. OGC KML 2.3 - Abstract Test Suite (OGC 14-068r2) 
	    3.OGC KML, Version 2.2 (OGC 07-147r2). The KML specification defines three conformance levels 
	    indicating the relative importance or priority of a particular set of constraints; each level 
	    successively increases the test coverage. The highest level (CL3) indicates full conformance, 
	    but a given application or user community may opt for a lower level of conformance. All three 
	    levels are implemented by the test suite:
		CL1 - Includes tests covering requirements that must be satisfied by every (minimally) conforming KML resource.
		CL2 - As for CL1, plus tests that address recommended constraints that should be satisfied; 
		non-conformance at this level may hinder the utility, portability, or interoperability of the resource.
		CL3 - As for CL2, plus tests for optional constraints that are purely informative in nature. 
		The test run arguments are summarized in the following table. The obligation descriptor can 
		have the following values: M (mandatory), O (optional), or C (conditional).
